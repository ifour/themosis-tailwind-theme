Themosis framework - Theme
==========================

The Themosis framework is a tool aimed to WordPress developers of any levels. But the better WordPress and PHP knowledge you have the easier it is to work with.

Themosis framework is a tool to help you develop websites and web applications faster using [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/). Using an elegant and simple code syntax, Themosis framework helps you structure and organize your code and allows you to better manage and scale your WordPress websites and applications.

Development team
----------------
The framework was created by [Julien Lamb√©](http://www.themosis.com/), who continues to lead the development.

Tailwind Set Up
---------------

Additionally this starter theme includes a Tailwind CSS starter point.  Please note the woocommerce base include from the main Themosis theme has been removed for now.

Installation
------------

Composer require something...

Within your theme folder install the theme assets with NPM or Yarn:

`npm install`
or
`yarn`

The `webpack.mix.js` file has been updated to use the generated Tailwind `theme.css` file within the assets directory. An empty `tailwind.config.js` has also been included.  Refer to the [Tailwind Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration) for additional configuration options.
